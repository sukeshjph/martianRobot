# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

-------------------------------------------
1: Node.js was not necessary as javascript can be run in the browser


2: In dev mode webpack-dev-server runs the frontend code


3: The code can also be run in a remote node.js server but that includes setting up additional overhead of managing side effects 
   like axios, node-fetch then async side effects libraries like redux or graphql(if node.js is based on it) 


4: Simply yarn install and Yarn start or find the deployed app below


5: I used React Hooks to encapsulate business logic, Typescript Model classes, React component to run the code and using 
   beautiful Material-UI components
